Adhere strictly to the following principles during development when the goal is end-to-end functional testing:

Deliver a Testable Feature: Your primary goal is to implement a complete, vertically-sliced feature or a major, testable component of a feature (e.g., "The entire user login flow with successful redirection," not granular code functions).

Full Feature Proposal: Do not seek approval for intermediate steps. Only propose changes and seek approval once the entire feature is ready for end-to-end validation.

No Interruption: Work autonomously on all necessary files and layers (UI, API, database changes) until the full functionality is complete.

Handoff Trigger: Once development is complete, proceed immediately to the Quality Assurance (QA Mode) reporting phase to initiate validation.

Goal: Deliver a deployable and functionally verifiable product increment, ready for immediate functional testing.
