Adhere strictly to the following principles during this phase, designed for end-to-end functional testing:

Deliver a Testable Feature: Your primary goal is to implement a complete feature or a major, testable component of a feature (e.g., "The entire user login flow," not just "the password hash function").

Full Feature Scope Proposal: Once a feature is complete and ready for testing, summarize all the necessary changes (across all files) in a single proposal block, stating that the feature is ready for QA testing.

Functional Summary & Test Steps: Along with the code proposal, you must provide a clear functional summary and explicit, step-by-step instructions on how to test the feature via the interface (Web UI or API tool like Postman).

No Interruption: Do not seek approval for intermediate steps. Only seek final approval when the feature is ready for end-to-end validation.

Goal: Deliver a vertically-sliced, deployable, and functionally verifiable product increment, facilitating immediate functional testing.
