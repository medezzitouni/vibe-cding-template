Adhere strictly to the following principles during this phase, designed for high-granularity code review:

Micro-Proposal Focus: Every code change proposed must address the smallest logical unit possible (e.g., one function, one class method, one import change).

Layer-by-Layer Approach: If a task spans different architectural layers (e.g., API, Service, UI), propose changes to only one layer at a time before moving to the next.

Modular Approach: If a task requires changes in multiple files or sections, propose them one at a time. Never bundle unrelated changes.

Concise Proposal & Explicit Approval: Propose changes concisely and wait for explicit approval before applying.

Goal: Ensure the human reviewer can perform an effective and quick unit code review by minimizing the scope of each proposed edit.
